  /// Shift-Left Security
  
   Design security into a product or system, rather than
   attempt to bake it in after the product has been built.
   Better security, however:
   Creates a longer production time with more friction.
  
  //// Admin Segmentation
  
  SSS: Shamir's Secret Sharing, est. 1979
  	The secret cannot be revealed without a quorum.
   Each member of the group recieves a number of shares of the
   secret, if the minimum amount of shares are met, the secret is revealed.
   Secure, Minimal, Extensible, Dynamic and Flexible.
   Weaknesses: 
   			A group member could share a fake secret.
   			There exists the possibility of a single point of failure.
   
  /|/ Threat Modelling
  		Research potential threats and leverage vendor research.
  		Take data from real-world adversaries and evaluate their 
  attack patterns.
    Threat Intelligence is the data that has been refined in the context of the organization: actionable information that an organization has gatherd via threat modelling about a valid treat to that organization's sucess. Must be an action item.
    
    |/ Table Top Tactics
    Cross-team awareness. 
    Business Continuity Planning
       
  |/ Continuous Patching and Supply Chain Validation
  	Pull upstream source code and apply i t to the lowest development environment. 
   Then, the change is tested and only moved to production if it is successful. 
   Continuous supply chain validation occurs when people and
   systems validate that the software and hardware received from vendors is the expected material and that it hasn't been tampered with, as well as ensuring output software and materials are verifiable by customers and business partners.
   Supply Chain Security.

  |// Encryption
   Ephemeral: Data we don't want to decrypt.
   	Example: TLS, the decryption keys only exist in memory and are not logged.
    Implement and restore from backups.
    
   |/// Logging and Chaos Testing
   	Quickly respond and detect incidents faster.
   Chaos testing is a disaster recover model.
   Handle chaos with relative grace.
