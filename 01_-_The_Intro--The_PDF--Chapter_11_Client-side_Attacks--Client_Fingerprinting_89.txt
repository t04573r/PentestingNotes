#### Client Fingerprinting








		Client fingerprinting allows us to obtain OS and browser info from a target in a non-routable internal network.
		theHarvester could gather emails to find a target to receive an HTA (HTML Application) that will run in Microsoft Edge or IE.
		Canarytokens are received in a link and display the opener's browser, os and IP info.
		Any poisonous link should be given with pretext, framing the situation and appealing to the target's sense of urgency, emotional state or many other things.
