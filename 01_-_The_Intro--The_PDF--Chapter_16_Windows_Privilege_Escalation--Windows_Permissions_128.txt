 A SID is a unique value assigned to each entity or principal that can be authenticaed by Windows, such as users and groups. The SID for local accounts and groups is generated by the LSA and for domain users and domain groups its generated on a Domain Controller (DC). The SID cannot be changed and is generated when the group or user is cereated. WIndows only uses SID and not usernames to identify principals for access control management. 
 The SID string consists of different parts delimited by - and reprensented by the place holders S,R,X and Y.
