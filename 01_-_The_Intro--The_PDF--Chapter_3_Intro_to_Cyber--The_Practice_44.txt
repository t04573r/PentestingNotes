#### The Practice


//// Challenges

Security involves msalicious and intelligent opponents.
Unlike protection from a natural occuring or accidental
problem, we need to consider the mindset, perspective and 
potential actions of our opponents. Our opponents are human
beings, meaning they have agency (judgment) as well as feeling emotions.

Security involves reasoning under uncertainty. We are not omniscient and cannot remember infinite facts. We must
make decisions based on incomplete information.

//// Mindset

	A mindset is a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective.
	The mindset in which we believe ourselves capable of recovering from a mistake makes us measurably able to do so.
	The security mindset constantly questions how one can attack or defend a system. If we ask this question automatically when encountering a novel idea, machine, system, network, or object, we can start noticing a wide array of recurring patters.
	
	The Try Harder mindset, in the event of failure, considers two perspectives:
		1. If my attack fails, it represents a truth about my current skills, processes, configurations, approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
		2. If my attack fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, refine my skills and do something differently.
		
//// Mind Emulation
	An audit helps an entity fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.
	A pentester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the gaps in a system's defense.
