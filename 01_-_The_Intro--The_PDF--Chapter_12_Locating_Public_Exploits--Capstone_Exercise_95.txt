#### Capstone Exercise



Host Enumeration

Host: 192.168.210.52

Port scan results:
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.4p1 Ubuntu 5ubuntu1.2 protocol 2.0

Deep Port Scan results:

32822/tcp open  james-admin JAMES Remote Admin 2.3.2
32823/tcp open  nntp        JAMES nntpd (posting ok)
32824/tcp open  pop3    syn-ack JAMES pop3d 2.3.2
32825/tcp open  smtp    JAMES smtpd 2.3.2
32826/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 

Initial Foothold:
Pop3d 2.3.2 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack in the case that pop3subfolders exist on the server.
No popsubfolders appear to be defined. 



OpenSSH < 7.7 is vulnerable to a User Enumeration attack.
However, all usernames are reported as valid.

Apache James server is vulnerable to a RCE attack that requires a user to log in.

I used shinris3n's exploit script.



Once a user logged in, I received a reverse shell.
