## Serve Git Repo Over HTTP
This takes a repo in path/to/repo and serves it from a new directory called repo-http. Iâ€™ve tested it on GNU/Linux, but it should even work on Windows if you use rename instead of mv.

git --bare clone path/to/repo repo-http
cd repo-http/.git
git --bare update-server-info
mv hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update
cd ..
python -m http.server 8000
# If using python2:
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

The Python command starts a web server that stays running in the foreground, dumping request logs to the console. Keep it running and use another terminal for other work. It should now be possible to access your repo from another machine over port 8000:

git clone http://example.com:8000/ repo

If you update the original repository on the same machine, you can push the changes to the serving copy:

git push --all path/to/repo-http
