### Challenge: racecar
curling the ip address:port returns HTTP 0.9 error
it's a telnet 
the telnet opens an ELF game
the game is vulnernable to format string attack.
the pointer addresses contain the flag on the stack.
%p %p %p %p... doesnt work (maybe the addresses are stored in a different order than the variables on the stack?)
try 

format_string = ' '.join([f'%{i+1}$x' for i in range(24)])

to get:



to convert to ASCII:

ascii_string = bytearray.fromhex(hex_string).decode('utf-8')
