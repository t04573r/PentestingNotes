### Chapter 13: Fixing Exploits




			Many public exploits won't work with stock settings and require 
			modification in order to work in our specific attack scenario.
			Memory corruption exploits such as buffer overflows may need to
			be modified to contain the correct parameters such as socket info,
			return address, payload and offsets.
			Exploits that are written for Windows 2003 Server may need to be modified 
			to circumvent modern protection mechanisms such as Address Space 
			Layout Randomization (ASLR). Not only will the exploit not work, but it could 
			cause the production environment to go down.
			Some exploits can be easily ported to another operating system or a 
			different programming language.
			Web app exploits may require a modification of the socket, URI or cookies.
			
			Sometimes source code will need to be cross-compiled. mingw-w64 is the tool for this.
			Here's an example of using mingw:
			
			i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -lws2_32
			
			The -l option instructs mingw to include a library.
			
			ASLR modules will have their JMP ESP addresses randomized at boot time.
