#### Threats and Threat Actors

\ On Threats and Threat Actors

To the fascination of security practitioners, cybersecurity
involves multiple agents trying to achiee mutually
exclusive outcomes on the control over the same asset. Both
roles, defender and attacker, subsist on the continued
persistence of the other. 

Each will become more skilled and more sophisticated because
of the efforts, both real and imagined, of their counterpart.
