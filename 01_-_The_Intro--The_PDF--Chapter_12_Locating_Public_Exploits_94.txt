### Chapter 12: Locating Public Exploits






														ch.12 Locating Exploits





					An exploit is a program or script that can leverage a flaw or 
					vulnerability of a target system. Exploits can have a range of 
					effects, such as DoS, Priv Esc, and RCE.
					Searching for appropriate exploits becomes a critical skill.
					
					Running exploits can greatly comprimise a system or network.
					
					After info gathering and enumeration, we can cross-check any 
					discovered vulnerabilities in an attempt to find published exploits.
					
					Exploit-DB is a free archive of public exploits maintained by OffSec.
					Packet Storm is an info sec website that provides up-to-date exploits.
					Github, Google and searchsploit are all key resources.
					
					An exploit framework is a software package that contains reliable 
					exploits for easy execution against a target.
					
					Metasploit, Core Impact, Canvas, BeEF are all exploit frameworks.
					
					Potentially usable exploits (EDB-ID) for the exam include:
						31337, 16888, 40616, 42030, 45796, 45743
						
					nmap's NSE is a great resource as well.
