##### Capstone Exercise
Enmerate the Target.

nmap 192.168.215.199 -sV

The host appears to be running a mail server:

PORT    STATE SERVICE       VERSION
25/tcp  open  smtp          hMailServer smtpd
80/tcp  open  http          Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
110/tcp open  pop3          hMailServer pop3d
135/tcp open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
143/tcp open  imap          hMailServer imapd
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds?
587/tcp open  smtp          hMailServer smtpd
Service Info: Host: ADMIN; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows

First, I'll try sending an email via one of the services on the host.

telnet 192.168.215.199 25

EHLO is allowed with any email address.
VRFY is not allowed.

MAIL FROM:bad@worse.com
SEND TO: admin@admin
530 auth is required.

Let's check the IIS hosted on port 80 for any valid email addresses.

Nothing interesting is hosted and dirbuster failed to find any dirs or files.

The SMTP Server on Port 587 has the same protection.

Let's try uploading a test file to the SMB service on port 445.

smbclient //192.168.50.195/share -c 'put config.Library-ms'

We get the error: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

nmblookup -A 192.168.215.199 
nbtscan
smbmap - H 

Here's a script to determine POP3 capabilities:
nmap --script "pop3-capabilities or pop3-ntlm-info" -sV -port <PORT> <IP> #All are default scripts

Next I tried cadaver to connect to any open dav shares.
The server returned a 405 error.

net view \\admin
Access is denied

dir \\admin\share 
Password is incorrect

dir \\admin\
Path is invalid

So we know \\admin\share is the correct path.
