#### SSH Dynamic Port Forward
"
This is powerful. In SSH dynamic port fowarding, packets can be sent to a single listening SOCKS port on the SSH client machine. These will be pushed through the SSH connection, then forwarded to anywhere the SSH server machine can route. The only limitation is that the packets have to be properly formatted - most often by SOCK-compatible client software.
