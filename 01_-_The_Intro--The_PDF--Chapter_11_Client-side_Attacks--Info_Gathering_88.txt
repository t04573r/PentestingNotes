#### Info Gathering





		Various methods of enumerating a target's installed software without interacting with the target machine exist. These techniques are best when we have no way to interact with the target. We won't be alerting any monitoring 
		systems or leaving forensic traces of our inquiry if we don't interact with the target.
		
		One approach is to inspect the metadata tags of publicly-available documents associated with the target organization. Although this data can be manually sanitized, it often is not. These tags can contain a variety of information, such as:
		-Author
		-Creation Date
		-Name
		-Version
		-Software Used to Create
		-Client OS
		-Etc..
	Data may be explicitly stored in the metadata or inferred. The age of the document may comprimise its legitimacy.
	
	This “hands-off” style of data gathering is viable but sometimes returns false information.
	
	gobuster -x can be leveraged to specify which filetype you'd like to search for on the server.
	
	exiftool -a -u is utilizted to display the metadata of any supported file.
